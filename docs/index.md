# Calculation Tools Documentation

## Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for the Calculation Tools suite. This project comprises three powerful tools designed to assist in the planning and deployment of broadband networks. These tools are vital for making informed decisions about technology selection and cost estimation for various types of broadband network deployments.

## Tools Overview

### Broadband Calculation Tool: Schools

This tool is designed to calculate the costs and select the appropriate technologies needed to connect schools to the Internet. It evaluates both internal school computer networks and their connections to broadband access networks, helping to choose the optimal network deployment options in terms of capital and operational expenses.

### Broadband Calculation Tool: Countries

This tool focuses on calculating the costs and selecting technologies required to connect unconnected localities to the broadband transport backbone and build broadband access networks. The results are presented as “Country Blueprints,” which provide a summary of analysis and calculations based on a comprehensive localities database, utilizing data from OpenStreetMap, GeoNames, ITU Broadband Maps, and other sources.

### Broadband Calculation Tool: Global

Similar to the Countries tool, this global tool is designed to calculate the costs and select technologies for connecting unconnected localities on a broader scale. It also generates “Country Blueprints” that summarize analysis and calculations, drawing on data from global geodata projects and mapping resources.

## Definitions 

**Old tool** is the original and unaltered tool. This is in its original state and has not been modified or updated

**Modified tool** is the updated version of the old tool. This version has edits made, package and version updates, and frontend edits 

## Prerequisites

Before using these tools, ensure that your environment meets the necessary prerequisites:

* **Docker**
* **Node**
* **npm**
* **pyenv**
* **PHP**

For detailed prerequisites, see:
