This guide provides detailed instructions on how to maintain the Calculation Tools project, ensuring it runs smoothly and efficiently over time. This includes managing dependencies, monitoring Docker images, securing the application, and handling backups and recovery.

## 1. Node Package Management

### 1.1 Overview

The Calculation Tools project is highly dependent on Node packages. Regularly updating and managing these packages is crucial to the system's stability and security.

### 1.2 Package Management Setup

To efficiently manage and update Node packages, we recommend using the **Package JSON Upgrade** extension in Visual Studio Code. This tool simplifies the process of checking for outdated packages and upgrading them.

#### **Setup Instructions** :

1. **Install the Extension** :

* Visit the Visual Studio Marketplace: [Package JSON Upgrade](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=codeandstuff.package-json-upgrade#:~:text=look%20like%20this%3A-,%22package%2Djson%2Dupgrade.,command%20called%20%22Toggle%20showing%20package).
* Click on "Install" to add the extension to your Visual Studio Code.

1. **Using the Extension** :

* Open your `package.json` file in Visual Studio Code.
* Use the command `Toggle showing package updates` to check for available package updates.
* Follow the prompts to upgrade any outdated packages.

### 1.3 Regular Maintenance

* **Check for Updates** : Regularly check for package updates to ensure the system remains secure and up-to-date.
* **Audit for Vulnerabilities** : Run `npm audit` periodically to identify and fix vulnerabilities in your dependencies.

## 2. Docker Image Management

### 2.1 Overview

The Calculation Tools project uses several Docker images to encapsulate its various components. Maintaining these images is critical to the project's performance and reliability.

### 2.2 Specific Docker Images

Below are the Docker images used in this project, along with their identifiers and sizes:

* **Size** : 581.07 MB

### 2.3 Regular Maintenance

* **Image Updates** : Regularly check for and apply updates to these images to ensure they are running the latest versions with security patches.
* **Image Size Management** : Monitor the sizes of your Docker images and clean up any unnecessary layers or intermediate images to conserve disk space.
* **Container Health Checks** : Implement health checks for Docker containers to automatically restart them in case of failures.

## 3. Monitoring and Logging

### 3.1 Overview

Monitoring and logging are essential for tracking the performance and health of your Docker containers and the overall application.

### 3.2 Tools and Setup

* **Monitoring** : Use tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or cloud-native services (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor) to monitor container metrics such as CPU usage, memory consumption, and network traffic.
* **Logging** : Set up centralized logging using tools like ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or cloud-native logging services. Ensure that all Docker containers send logs to a centralized location for easy access and analysis.

### 3.3 Regular Maintenance

* **Log Rotation** : Implement log rotation policies to prevent log files from consuming too much disk space.
* **Alerting** : Set up alerts for critical metrics (e.g., high CPU usage, low memory) to proactively address issues.

## 4. Backup and Recovery

### 4.1 Regular Backups

* **Data Backups** : Regularly back up all persistent data stored in databases like MySQL. Use tools like `mysqldump` or cloud-native backup services.
* **Configuration Backups** : Back up configuration files, environment variables, and Docker Compose files to ensure they can be restored if needed.

### 4.2 Recovery Procedures

* **Database Recovery** : Document and test the process of restoring database backups to minimize downtime in case of data loss.
* **Container Recovery** : Have procedures in place to quickly rebuild and redeploy Docker containers in case of failures.

## 5. Security Maintenance

### 5.1 Regular Updates

* **Package Updates** : Regularly update Node packages, Docker images, and system packages to ensure the latest security patches are applied.
* **Secrets Management** : Use secure methods to manage secrets (e.g., passwords, API keys) like AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or environment variables managed securely in Docker Compose files.

### 5.2 Access Controls

* **Least Privilege** : Ensure that Docker containers and cloud resources operate with the least privileges necessary.
* **Firewall and Network Security** : Regularly review and update firewall rules, security groups, and network ACLs to restrict access to only trusted IP addresses.

## 6. Performance Optimization

### 6.1 Container Resource Management

* **Resource Allocation** : Adjust CPU and memory allocations for Docker containers to optimize performance.
* **Scaling** : Use Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, or cloud-native scaling solutions to scale containers based on demand.

### 6.2 Regular Audits

* **Performance Audits** : Conduct regular performance audits to identify and resolve bottlenecks.
* **Load Testing** : Perform load testing periodically to ensure the application can handle increased traffic.

## 7. Troubleshooting

### 7.1 Common Issues

* **Container Failures** : Document common container failures and their resolutions (e.g., out-of-memory errors, network connectivity issues).
* **Dependency Conflicts** : Keep a log of any dependency conflicts that arise and how they were resolved.

### 7.2 Support and Resources

* **Documentation** : Regularly update project documentation to reflect any changes in dependencies, Docker images, or cloud configurations.
* **Community Support** : Engage with the community and cloud provider support channels to address complex issues.
